          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to
            a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on
            Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
            Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and
            imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu
            pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited
            Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one
            sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy
            Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large
            tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal
            Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and
            local women. The family business had involved trading groceries
            between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as
            well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the
            opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
            businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
            the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
            poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had
            to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
